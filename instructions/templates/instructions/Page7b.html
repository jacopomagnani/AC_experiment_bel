<p>
    The <b>computer will decide on behalf of the passive player</b> whether to form a partnership or not.

Specifically, if the passive playerâ€™s type is Z or Y, the computer will always choose to form a partnership.

 If the type of the passive player is X, the computer will choose to form a partnership with some probability, for example with 50% probability.

    <b>The actual probability will change</b> in each round, <b>depending on the version of the game</b> you are playing.

There are five versions of this game, called <b>A, B, C, D and E</b>.

There will be 12 rounds for each game but the exact sequence of games will be random.

The following table shows you the actual probability that the computer will choose to form a partnership on behalf of the passive player in different games.
