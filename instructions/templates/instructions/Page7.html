<ul>
    <li>When you are <b>an active player</b>, after you have received a clue about your potential partner’s type, you <b>can decide whether you want to form a partnership or not</b>.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>
    The computer will decide on behalf of the passive player whether he agrees to form a partnership or not.

Specifically, if the passive player’s type is Z or Y, the computer will always agree to form a partnership.

 If the type of the passive player is X, the computer will agree to form a partnership with some probability, for example with 50% probability.

The actual probability will depend on which version of the game you are playing in a round.

There are five versions of this game, called A, B, C, D and E.

There will be 12 rounds for each game but the exact sequence of games will be random.

The following table reports the actual probability that the computer will propose to form a partnership on behalf of an X type player in different games.

</p>


<p>
    Only if the active player proposes to form a partnership and the computer acting on the passive player’s behalf agrees, then a partnership is formed.

    For example, if you are an active player and propose to form a partnership but the computer of the passive player does not agree, the partnership is not formed.
