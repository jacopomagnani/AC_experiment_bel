</h5>

<br>
<p>When you are <b>an active player</b>, after you have received a clue about your potential partner’s type, you <b>can decide whether you want to form a partnership or not</b></p>
<br>
<p>
    The <b>computer will decide on behalf of the passive player</b> whether to form a partnership or not.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Only if <b>both the active player and the computer</b> acting on the passive player’s behalf choose to form a partnership, then a partnership is formed.

    For example, if you are an active player and choose to form a partnership but the computer of the passive player chooses not to, the partnership is not formed.
